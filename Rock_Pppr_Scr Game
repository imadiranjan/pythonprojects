with a simple project where the developer will have to create the game
of rock-paper-scissors. The player will have to pick rock, paper or scissors
and the computer will choose the move. Then the winner will be decided and
the results printed. In this project, the developer is expected to have the
following subgoals:


Give the player the option to play again
Keep a record of the score'''
